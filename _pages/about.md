I am a research assistant in the [Computer Vision & Machine Learning Lab](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~liutyng/) at the [Institute of Information Science (IIS)](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/index.html), Academia Sinica, under the mentorship of Prof. [Tyng-Luh Liu](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/liutyng/index_en.html). Prior to joining IIS, I completed the Master's degree in [Integrated Circuits & Systems group (ICS)](https://giee.ntu.edu.tw/en/ics_lecture.php) from the [Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering](https://giee.ntu.edu.tw/en/) at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). This followed my undergraduate studies at [National Chiao Tung University (NCTU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Chiao_Tung_University).

My research has primarily focused on [1] representation learning without supervision by human annotations. [2] tackling existing computer vision problems via leveraging diffusion/consistency models. [3] efficient Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). <br>

Overall, my work lies at the nexus of of <b>computer vision</b> and <b>energy-efficient tiny-ML models</b>, particularly emphasizing unsupervised (self-supervised) representation learning and the development of compact yet effective machine learning models for computer vision applications. In the future, I aspire to address three fundamental questions that stand at the core of my research interests:

<ol>
<li>How can we harness the vast array of unlabeled natural data to construct an accurate world simulator or model?</li>
<li>In what ways can the diffusion and consistency mechanisms refine existing computer vision solutions?</li>
<li>How can we optimize the synergy between algorithms and hardware structures to boost the efficiency of Large Multimodal Models in IoT contexts?</li>
</ol>

Apart from my research, I am passionate about exploring innovative applications in computer vision that incorporate diverse modalities, including point clouds, text and audio.
